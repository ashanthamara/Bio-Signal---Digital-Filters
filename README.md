# Bio-Signal---Digital-Filters
This repository is about the Digital Filters learnt in the Bio Signal Processing Module

# Introduction
This study allows implementing digital filters on MATLAB and applying them to biomedical signals. 

## 1. Smoothing filters
One of the most common signal processing tasks is smoothing of the data to reduce high frequency noise arising from electromagnetic interferences, quantization errors and from peripheral physiological signals. Here, the application of moving average filters of order N (MA(N)) and Savitzky-Golay filters of order N and length L‚Äô= 2L + 1 (SG(N,L))

### 1.1. Moving average MA(N) filter
A MA(N) filter can be visualised as a moving window across the signal. A point of the filtered signal ùë¶(ùëõ) is derived from the average of the windowed points on the input signal ùë•(ùëõ).

#### Data set characteristics
Name                    : ECG_template.mat
Sampling frequency (fs) : 500 Hz
Amplitude range         : mV

Here we are using a ECG_template.mat and then add 5 dB Gaussian Noise to that data set to obtain a noisy ECG signal. After that we apply the designed Moving Average Filter and observe the characteristics of the signal.

After adjusting the time scale with the sampling frequency of 500 Hz, we can observe an ECG pulse as shown in above figure. In there we can clearly observe the P wave, QRS complex and the T wave of a typical ECG signal.

5 dB Gaussian Noise is added to the ECG_template data set using ‚Äúawgn(x, snr, ‚Äòmeasured‚Äô)‚Äù function and both noisy signal and the reference signal is plotted in a single figure.

Power Spectral Density gives the signal power in different frequency components of a signal. When looking into the above figure, we can clearly see that, the ECG signal power is prominent in the lower frequencies (< 50 Hz) and the noisy ECG signal has more power in high frequencies due to the added noise.

After compensating the group delay, we can see that both signals get aligned in the time domain and after applying the Moving Average filter, signal has smoothened by reducing the high frequency variation.

Above figure drastically shows that the removal of high frequency components of the signal after applying the Moving Average filter. The signal power in high frequencies is reduced but the low frequencies (<50 Hz) are not affected by the filter.

### Moving Average Filter Implementation using built-in function

The filtered signal has smoothened the noisy signal by reducing high frequency variations like in the signal filtered using the derived Moving Average Filter

### MA(10) filter implementation with the built-in function

By increasing the order of the filter, we are using higher number of points to obtain the average. And that will reduce more amount of high frequency noise in the signal.
The response of the MA(3) crosses the threshold of -3dB magnitude around 0.3 of the normalized frequency, while for MA(10), frequencies above 0.03 of the normalized frequency is cut-off.

As supposed, the ECG signal filtered by MA(10) filter is more smoother than the MA(3) filtered signal and the noisy ECG signal. Also, it has low number of high frequency noise compared to the other noisy signals. Due to the averaging the MA(10) filter itself smooth the peaks of the signal, additionally. 

### Optimum MA(N) filter order

Lower order Moving Average filtered signals may contain considerable amount of high frequency noise while high order moving average filters may remove the original signal components apart form the noise components. So, finding an optimum order for a moving average filter will lead to a best filtered signal.

Observed Optimum Filter Order = 12
With high filter orders, the window will use higher number of data points to calculate the average of a point. And it may lead to giving a more global average while compensating the signal data points over noise components. Due to that reason higher filter orders show high Mean Squared Error values.

### 1.2.	Savitzky-Golay SG(N, L) filter

Savitzky-Golay filter fits a polynomial of order N to an odd number of data points L‚Äô=2L+1(where L‚Äô is an odd integer) in predefined window in a least-squares sense. A unique solution requires ùëÅ‚â§ùêø‚Äô-1.

By applying Savitzky-Golay filter is also smoothened the signal by suppressing the high frequency noises in the noisy ECG signal.

Observed Optimum Polynomial Order(N) = 4
Observed Optimum Length of the Window (L) = 17

The optimum SG filter is able to maintain lesser MSE, more smoothens the signal, higher detection of the peaks than the SG(3,10) filter.

Time elapsed for optimum MA Filter = 0.000110 seconds.
Time elapsed for optimum SG Filter = 0.003004 seconds.
Both filters smoothen the noisy ECG signal by removing high frequency components while Savitzky-Golay filter has more smoothen effect. According to the time analysis data, Moving Average Filter is computationally more efficient since it is ~27 faster than the  Savitzky-Golay filter.
